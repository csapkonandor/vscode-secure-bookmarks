You only need the VS Code extension packaging tool:

npm install -g vsce
or locally
npm install --save-dev vsce

Then inside your extension folder:

npx vsce package

This produces:

secure-bookmarks-0.0.1.vsix

You can install it in VS Code:

Open VS Code

Press Ctrl+Shift+P

Run Extensions: Install from VSIX

Select the .vsix file
